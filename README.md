# Ludo

Ludo is a South Asian board game where four players
race their four tokens across the board from start
to finish. Whoever gets all four tokens "home" first
wins the game.

## Rules

The tokens start out in their yards. Each player takes
a turn rolling the die. If they roll a six or a one, the
player may take out a token and place it on their starting
position in the pathway. 

Whenever a player rolls a six, they get a bonus roll. If 
the bonus roll results in another six, the player gets 
another roll. But if the third roll results in a six, then 
the previous rolls do not count and the player must start 
their rolls over again. 

The player can only advance when the token is taken out
of the yard. Once a token is outside the yard, they must 
move the token according to the value they rolled. If they 
roll a six or a one, they may take out another token from 
the yard or they can advance the tokens that are outside.

If the token that is advancing lands on a square that is
occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent is sent back
to its own yard. The returned token can enter again when its
player rolls a six or a one. 

If the token that is advancing lands on a square that is occupied
by another one of its own token, then it becomes a double token and
can block other players from advancing. If the player rolls an even
number, they can advance the double token half the amount of that
roll. But if they roll an even number, they would have to break
the double token if they have no other tokens on the board to advance.

When a token is on a colored space, they are safe. When a player
makes a full run through the board safely, they enter their home
column. In order to get to their home triangle, they must roll the
exact amount of spaces they need to enter their home. 

## Design
While running the program, the user should open up the annotated image of the 
Ludo board so they can see where their tokens are located.
